# React Todo

In this project, my main focus was on mastering the fundamental aspects of React features. These included:

- **Exporting functions**
- **Creating separate modules**
- **Passing props**
- **Conditional rendering**
- **Event handling**
- **Using the useState hook**
- **State lifting**
- **Using external libraries**
- **Practicing with the Tailwind CSS library**

## Additional Notes and Achievements

While working on these fundamental aspects, I also achieved experience with external libraries the following:

- [Drag and drop library](@https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd)
- [Modal library](@https://github.com/reactjs/react-modal)

## Future Enhancements

To further enhance the project, consider incorporating the following:

- Establish communication with a backend server to enable data persistence.
- Explore technologies like [Express](https://expressjs.com/) for backend development.
- Database integration for storing and retrieving task data.
